`challengify inject` is a deprecated draft for the `iterate` sub command

the goal was to generate solutions from branches of a repo

## commands

``` bash
challengify inject .challengify_actions.yaml      # runs injections listed in file
challengify inject .sync_actions.yaml             # runs injections listed in file
```
