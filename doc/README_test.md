`challengify test` generates *test challengification* files for the provided scope, with each file located next to the source file

## commands

``` bash
challengify test                        # generate *test challengification* files for the scope
                                        # all files are generated in place (next to the source file: the destination parameter of the run command is ignored)
                                        # the file root is suffixed by `_challengify`:
                                        # `path/to/stuff.md` => `path/to/stuff_challengify.md`

challengify clean                       # remove all *test challengification* files in the current directory
                                        # no undo command available
```

## generated files

any file matching the pattern `*_challengify*` or `.*_challengify*` is considered a *test challengification* file generated by this command and is considered fair game to write or remove

no safeguards are provided when writing or removing such files, which are considered temporary data and can be gitignored
